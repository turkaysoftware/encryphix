# How to use Encryphix?

After downloading the Encryphix application, you will find two options: **Encryphix_x64.exe** and **Encryphix_arm64.exe**. Which file to choose depends on your computerâ€™s processor architecture. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you decide which version is right for you:

#### 1. Encryphix_x64.exe
- **Encryphix_x64.exe** is designed for computers with an x64 (64-bit) processor architecture.
- If youâ€™re using a standard Windows PC or laptop, you likely need the x64 version.
- Most devices with Intel or AMD processors use the x64 architecture.

#### 2. Encryphix_arm64.exe
- **Encryphix_arm64.exe** is specifically developed for devices with an ARM64 architecture.
